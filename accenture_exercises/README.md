### Python functions that are heavily used
There are few functions in these exercises that I have used heavily. Those functions needs to be thoroughly understood. These functions will help you in writing python code more quickly and efficiently.

1. range() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-range-function/
2. join() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-join-method/
3. split() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-split/
4. isupper() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-isupper-method/?ref=lbp
5. isdigit() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-isdigit-method/?ref=lbp
6. input() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-input-function/
7. Typecasting - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-casting-in-python/

There are some other functions which are good to know
1. strip() - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-strip/
2. Math module - (No need to go in detail)
