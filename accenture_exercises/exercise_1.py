"""
1. Execute the given function.
def differenceofSum(n.m)

The function takes two integrals m and n as arguments. You are required to obtain the total of all integers ranging between 1 to n (both inclusive) which are not divisible by m. You must also return the distinction between the sum of integers not divisible by m with the sum of integers divisible by m.

Assumption

m > 0 and n > 0
Sum lies within the integral range 

Example
Input:
m = 6
n = 30

Output:
285
