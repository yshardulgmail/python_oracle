"""
14. Change frequent character
The function to execute is
ChatFrequentcharacter(Char str, char x)

This function has a string and a character. This function requires replacing the most used character in the str with the ‘x’ character.

Note: If two characters have the same frequency, then we will have to consider the frequency which has the lower ASCII value.

Example

Input:
str: bbadbbababb
char x: t

Output:
ttadttatatt
